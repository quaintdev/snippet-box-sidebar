# Snippet Box Sidebar
This extension adds a [Snippet Box](https://github.com/pawelmalak/snippet-box) sidebar to your Firefox as shown in screenshot below. This allows easy saving of code snippets to your self hosted instance. Once installed your instance url must be configured in preferences of extension for it to work properly. 

Your feedback is highly appreciated.
